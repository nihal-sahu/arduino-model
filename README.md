# arduino-model

A custom model of an Arduino Uno Rev3 made with Altium Designer 21. 

-All components were designed from scratch using DigiKey manafacturer part #'s. 
-All PCB footprints were designed from scratch by checking manafacturing specifications.
-PCB board and Schematic were made with these custom components
-Reviewed and edited by members of UWRT

*About this project:*
This project is by no means final, many things need to be changed in order for this board to be fully working when manafactured. This project was made to learn how to use Altium Designer 21, as well as the basics of PCB design in order to employ those skills for the University of Waterloo Robotics Team. This project was made with reference to the PCB design tutorial offered by FEDEVEL academy.
